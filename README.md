# Cake Components
Perfectly baked and decorated components for any occasion.

## Background of project
Complex web applications are no longer created as a collection of views that represent an entire page/route. Instead developers are taking queues from the functional programming paradigm and composing components to form complex application views. The component architecture has been spearheaded by the Open Source JavaScript library [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) and the miriad of 'React' like libraries such as [Inferno](https://github.com/infernojs/inferno), [Preact](https://github.com/developit/preact) etc... 

## What is a component
TODO distinguish between types of components

## What is Cake?
Cake is not so much a 'thing' but more of an approach to building highly reusable, semantic and easily themeable components.

Cake Component Development Cycle

1. Source should be the same irrespective of consuming framework. Components should be built using a well defined, agreed upon common api.

2. 

3.

```
source -> compiler (based on consuming framework) -> output
```

## Anatomy of a Cake component
The following prescribes a default list of ingredients that go into building a Cake Component. Your specific implementation may vary (e.g. structure, naming conventions...), but the end goal is the same: 'build once, build it right, use everywhere'.

### 1. Base
Just like any good cake base recipe, this should never be changed once perfected. The base of a Cake Component should be semantically correct, accessible and not include extra markup to achieve bespoke design requirements. The base is the foundation to which we apply the rest of the ingredients on top of. Bake all the good stuff in!

#### Example structure

##### HTML
```
[component-name].base.html
```
The `base.html` file should contain the semantic html structure of your component template. This does not necessarily have to be contained within a seperate `.html` file, in the case of [JSX](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/jsx-in-depth.html) this template would be generated within a `.js` or `.jsx` file.

##### JavaScript
```
[component-name].base.js
```
The `base.js` file should contain the minimal amount of javascript required to make your component operational and achieve accessibilty requirements. Again, this file is not neccessarily required.

##### CSS
```
[component-name].base.css
```
The `base.css` file is a minimal stylesheet that is generally used to create a 'vanilla' version of your component and reset default styles generated by specific browser implementations.

### 2. Filling
```
[component-name].filling.js
```

### 3. Sprinkles
```
[component-name].sprinkles.css
```
